## How do I stay motivated
There are lakhs of aspirants who slog for UPSC every day for 5-6 years, when they know that their probability of getting selected is 0.2%. You just have put some effort (2-4 hours a day) for 1 week. How hard can it be? Morever, if it helps, reach out to your family, friends or anyone who can keep you accountable and tell them that you are doing this andask them to keep you accontable

### Worst case scenario
In the worst case, after doing this 7 day challenge, you feel that Web Dev is not for you. In that case, you would have wasted 1 week of your life (rather some part of it). But truth be told, most of you would have wasted dozen of weeks if not hundreds, so wasting 1 week more would do no harm. On the flip side, it is also possible you actually end of deciding to continue learning web development, and in that case you have already laid the foundation in just 7 days and you only have to build on top of it

### Things to Note
1. We acknowledge that different people learn at different speeds, and some of you might want to increase/decrease the content covered on a particular day. However, since there are other learners involved, we would have to stick to the roadmap. If you have any backlog for any day, you can cover it up after the 7 day challenge is over
2. I do not commit to resolving any doubts. While I would like to clarify all doubts, and will clarify doubts whenever I can, with a job and other personal commitments, it sometimes just becomes impossible. Hence, if you face any doubts, first suggestion would be to Google it as 99.9% of the times someone else would also have faced the issue. Moreover there are other learners in the course who might help you with your doubts
3. This is the first cohort, so it might not be perfect. We will use the feedback from this cohort to improve the subsequent cohorts
4. The roadmap we would follow for this cohort is
